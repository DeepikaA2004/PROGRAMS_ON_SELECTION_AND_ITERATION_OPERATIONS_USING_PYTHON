# PROGRAMS_ON_SELECTION_AND_ITERATION_OPERATIONS_USING_PYTHON
To write a Python program get an integer input from a user. If the number is odd, then find the factorial of a number and the number of digits in the factorial of the number. If the number is even, then check whether the given number is palindrome or not.

# ALGORITHM
## STEP 1: Get an integer as input from the user.
## STEP 2: Check whether the input number is odd or even.
## STEP 3: If the number is even then print whether the number is palindrome or not.
## STEP 4: If the number is odd, find the number's factorial.
## STEP 5:Print the number of digits in the factorial of the number.
